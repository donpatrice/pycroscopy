Pycroscopy Data and File Format
===============================

**Suhas Somnath**

8/8/2017

In this document we aim to provide a comprehensive overview, guidelines,
and specifications for storing scientific data using the community-driven pycroscopy format.

**Dr. Stephen Jesse** conceived the original guidelines on structuring the data while
**Dr. Suhas Somnath** and **Chris R. Smith** implemented the data structure into the hierarchical data format (HDF5)

Nomenclature
--------------
Before we start off, lets clarify some nomenclature to avoid confusion.

Data model
~~~~~~~~~~~
Data model refers to the way the data is arranged. This does not depend on the implementation in a particular file format

File format
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This corresponds to the kind of file, such as a spreadsheet (.CSV), an image (.PNG), a text file (.TXT) within which information is contained.

Data format
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`data format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_format>`_ is actually a rather broad term. However, we have observed that
people often refer to the combination of a data model implemented within a file format as a ``data format``.

Dimensionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* We consider data recorded for all combinations of 2 or more variables as ``multi-dimensional`` datasets or ``tensors`` of order ``N``:

  * For example, if a single value of current is recorded as a function of driving / excitation bias or voltage having B values, the dataset is said to be ``1 dimensional`` and the dimension would be - ``Bias``.
  * If the bias is cycled C times, the data is said to be ``two dimensional`` with dimensions - ``(Bias, Cycle)``.
  * If the bias is varied over B values over C cycles at X columns and Y rows in a 2D grid of positions, the resultant dataset would have ``4 dimensions:`` ``(Rows, Columns, Cycle, Bias)``.
* ``Multi-feature``: As a different example, let us suppose that the ``petal width``, ``length``, and ``weight`` were measured for ``F`` different kinds of flowers. This would result in a ``1 dimensional dataset`` with the kind of flower being the sole dimension. Such a dataset is **not** a 3 dimensional dataset because the ``petal width, length``, and ``weight`` are only different ``features`` for each measurement. Some quantity needs to be **measured for all combinations of** petal width, length, and weight to make this dataset 3 dimensional. Most examples observed in data mining, simple machine learning actually fall into this category

Why should you care?
--------------------

The quest for understanding more about samples has necessitated the
development of a multitude of instruments, each capable of numerous
measurement modalities.

Proprietary file formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically, each commercial instruments generates data files formatted in
proprietary file formats by the instrument manufacturer. The proprietary
nature of these file formats and the obfuscated data model within the files impede scientific progress in the
following ways:

1. By making it challenging for researchers to extract data from these files
2. Impeding the correlation of data acquired from different instruments.
3. Inability to store results back into the same file
4. Inflexibility to accommodate few kilobytes to several gigabytes of data
5. Requiring different versions of analysis routines for each data format
6. In some cases, requiring proprietary software provided with the instrument to access the data

Future concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Several fields are moving towards the open science paradigm which will require journals and researchers to support
   journal papers with data and analysis software
2. US Federal agencies that support scientific research require curation of datasets in a clear and organized manner

Other problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The vast majority of scientific software packages (e.g. X-array) aim to focus at information already available in
   memory. In other words they do not solve the problem of storing data in a self-describing manner and reading +
   processing this data.
2. There are a few file formatting packages and approaches (Nexus, NetCDF). However, they are typically narrow in scope
   and only solve the data formatting for specific communities
3. Commercial image analysis software are often woefully limited in their capabilities and only work on simple 1, 2, and
   in some cases- 3D datasets. There are barely any software for handling arbitrarily large multi-dimensional datasets.
4. In many cases, especially electron and ion based microscopy, the very act of probing the sample damages the sample.
   To minimize damage to the sample, researchers only sample data from a few random positions in the 2D grid and use
   advanced algorithms to reconstruct the missing data. We have not come across any robust solutions for storing such
   **Compressed sensing / sparse sampling** data. More in the **Advanced Topics** section.

Pycroscopy Data Model
---------------------------

To solve the above and many more problems, we have developed an
**instrument agnostic data model** that can be used to represent data
from any instrument, size, dimensionality, or complexity.

Data in pycroscopy files are stored in three main kinds of datasets:

#. ``Main`` datasets that contain the raw measurements recorded from
   the instrument as well as results from processing or analysis routines
   applied to the data
#. Mandatory ``Ancillary`` datasets that are necessary to explain the
   ``main`` data
#. ``Extra`` datasets store any other data that may be of value

``Main`` Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regardless of origin, modality or complexity, imaging data (and most scientific data for that matter) have one
thing in common:

**The same measurement is performed at multiple spatial locations**

The data model in pycroscopy is based on this one simple ground-truth.
The data always has some ``spatial dimensions`` (X, Y, Z) and some
``spectroscopic dimensions`` (time, frequency, intensity, wavelength,
temperature, cycle, voltage, etc.). **In pycroscopy, the spatial
dimensions are collapsed onto a single dimension and the spectroscopic
dimensions are flattened to the other dimensions.** Thus, all data are
stored as two dimensional grids. While the data could indeed be stored
in the original N-dimensional form, there are a few key **advantages to
the 2D structuring**:

* The data is already of the same structure expected by machine learning algorithms and requires minimal
  to no pre-processing or post-processing.
* In certain cases, the data simply cannot be represented in an N-dimensional form since one of the dimensions
  has multiple sizes in different contexts.
* Researchers want to acquire ever larger datasets that
  take much longer to acquire. This has necessitated approaches such as
  sparse sampling or `compressed sensing
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing>`__ wherein
  measurements are acquired from a few randomly sampled positions and the
  data for the rest of the positions are inferred using complex
  algorithms. Storing such sparse sampled data in the N dimensional form
  would balloon the size of the stored data even though the majority of the
  data is actually empty. Two dimensional datasets would allow the random
  measurements to be written without any empty sections.
* When acquiring measurement data, users often adjust experimental parameters
  during the experiment that may affect the size of the data, especially the
  spectral sizes. Thus, changes in experimental parameters would mean that the
  existing N dimensional set would have to be left partially (in most cases
  largely) empty and a new N dimensional dataset would have to be allocated
  with the first few positions left empty. In the case of flattened datasets,
  the current dataset can be truncated at the point of the parameter change
  and a new dataset can be created to start from the current measurement.
  Thus, no space would be wasted.

Here are some examples of how some familiar data can be represented using
this paradigm:

-  **Gray-scale photographs**: A single value (intensity) in is recorded
   at each pixel in a two dimensional grid. Thus, there are are two
   spatial dimensions - X, Y and one spectroscopic dimension -
   "Intensity". The data can be represented as a N x 1 matrix where N is
   the product of the number of rows and columns of pixels. The second
   axis has size of 1 since we only record one value (intensity) at each
   location. *The positions will be arranged as row0-col0, row0-col1....
   row0-colN, row1-col0....* Color images or photographs will be
   discussed below due to some very important subtleties about the
   measurement.
-  A **single Raman spectra**: In this case, the measurement is recorded
   at a single location. At this position, data is recorded as a
   function of a single (spectroscopic) variable such as wavelength.
   Thus this data is represented as a 1 x P matrix, where P is the
   number of points in the spectra
-  **Scanning Tunnelling Spectroscopy or IV spectroscopy**: The current
   (A 1D array of size P) is recorded as a function of voltage at each
   position in a two dimensional grid of points (two spatial
   dimensions). Thus the data would be represented as a N x P matrix,
   where N is the product of the number of rows and columns in the grid
   and P is the number of spectroscopic points recorded.

Using prefixes ``i`` for position and ``j`` for spectroscopic, the main
dataset would be structured as:

+------------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+--------------+
| i0, j0     | i0, j1     | i0, j2     | <..>   | i0, jP-2     | i0, jP-1     |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+--------------+
| i1, j0     | i1, j1     | i1, j2     | <..>   | i1, jP-2     | i1, jP-1     |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+--------------+
| <......>   | <......>   | <......>   | <..>   | <........>   | <........>   |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+--------------+
| iN-2, j0   | iN-2, j1   | iN-2, j2   | <..>   | iN-2, jP-2   | iN-2, jP-1   |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+--------------+
| iN-1, j0   | iN-1, j1   | iN-1, j2   | <..>   | iN-1, jP-1   | iN-1, jP-1   |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+--------------+

* If the same voltage sweep were performed twice at each location, the data would be represented as N x 2 P.
  The data is still saved as a long (2*P) 1D array at each location. The number of spectroscopic dimensions
  would change from just ['Voltage'] to ['Voltage', 'Cycle'] where the second spectroscopic dimension would
  account for repetitions of this bias sweep.

  * **The spectroscopic data would be stored as it would be recorded as volt_0-cycle_0, volt_1-cycle_0.....
    volt_P-1-cycle_0, volt_0-cycle_1.....volt_P-1-cycle-1. Just like the positions**

* Now, if the bias was swept thrice from -1 to +1V and then thrice again from -2 to 2V, the data bacomes
  N x 2 * 3 P. The data now has two position dimensions (X, Y) and three spectrosocpic dimensions ['Voltage',
  'Cycle', 'Step']. The data is still saved as a (P * 2 * 3) 1D array at each location.

-  A collection of ``k`` chosen spectra would also be considered
   ``main`` datasets since the data is still structured as
   ``[instance, features]``. Some examples include:
-  the cluster centers obtained from a clustering algorithm like
   ``k-Means clustering``.
-  The abundance maps obtained from decomposition algorithms like
   ``Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)`` or
   ``Non-negetive matrix factorization (NMF)``

Complicated?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This data model may seem unnecessarily complicated for very simple / rigid data such as 2D images or 1D spectra.
However, bear in mind that this paradigm was designed to represent any information regardless of dimensionality, origin, complexity, etc.
Thus, encoding data in this manner will allow seamless sharing, exchange, and interpretation of data.

Compound Datasets:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are instances where multiple values are associate with a
single position and spectroscopic value in a dataset.  In these cases,
we use the Compound Dataset functionality in HDF5 to store all of the
values at each point.  This also allows us to access any combination of
the values without needing to read all of them.  Pycroscopy actually uses
compound datasets a lot more frequently than one would think. The need
and utility of compound datasets are best described with examples:

* **Color images**: Each position in these datasets contain three (red,
  blue, green) or four (cyan, black, magenta, yellow) values. One would
  naturally be tempted to simply treat these datasets as N x 3 datasets
  and it certainly is not wrong to represent data this way. However,
  storing the data in this model would mean that the red intensity was
  collected first, followed by the green, and finally by the blue. In
  other words, a notion of chronology is attached to both the position
  and spectroscopic axis if one strictly follows the pycroscopy defenition.
  While the intensities for each color may be acquired sequentially in
  detectors, we will assume that they are acquired simultaneously for
  this argument. In these cases, we store data using ``compound datasets``
  that allow the storage of multiple pieces of data within the same cell.
  While this may seem confusing or implausible, remember that computers
  store complex numbers in the same way. The complex numbers have a *real*
  and an *imaginary* component just like color images have *red*, *blue*,
  and *green* components that describe a single pixel. Therefore, color
  images in pycroscopy would be represented by a N x 1 matrix with
  compound values instead of a N x 3 matrix with real or integer values.
  One would refer to the red component at a particular position as
  ``dataset[position_index, spectroscopic_index]['red']``.
* **Functional fits**: Let's take the example of a N x P dataset whose
  spectra at each location are fitted to a complicated equation. Now the P
  points in the spectra will be represented by S coefficients that don't
  necessarily follow any order. Consequently, the result of the functional
  fit should actually be a N x 1 dataset where each element is a compound
  value made up of the S coefficients. Note that while some form of sequence
  can be forced onto the coefficients if the spectra were fit to polynomial
  equations, the drawbacks outweight the benefits:

  * Storing data in compund datasets circumvents (slicing) problems associated
    with getting a specific / the kth coeffient if the data were stored in a
    real-valued matrix instead.
  * Visualization also becomes a lot simpler since compound datasets cannot
    be plotted without specifying the component / coefficient of interest. This
    avoids plots with alternating coefficients that are several orders of
    magnitude larger / smaller than each other.

For more information on compound datasets see the `tutorial
<https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/compound.html>` from the HDF Group
and the `h5py Datasets documentation
<http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/high/dataset.html#reading-writing-data>`

``Ancillary`` Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each ``main`` dataset is always accompanied by four ancillary datasets to
help make sense of the flattened ``main`` dataset. These are the:

* The ``Position Values`` and ``Position Indices`` describe the index and
  value of any given row or spatial position in the dataset.
* The ``Spectroscopic Values`` and ``Spectroscopic Indices`` describe the
  spectroscopic information at the specific time.

In addition to serving as a legend or the key for the , these ancillary
datasets are necessary for explaining:

* the original dimensionality of the dataset
* how to reshape the data back to its N dimensional form

Much like ``main`` datasets, the ``ancillary`` datasets are also two
dimensional matrices regardless of the number of position or
spectroscopic dimensions. Given a main dataset with ``N`` positions in
``U`` dimensions and ``P`` spectral values in ``V`` dimensions:

* The ``Position Indices`` and ``Position Values`` datasets would both of the
  same size of ``N x U``, where ``U`` is the number of position
  dimensions. The columns would be arranged in ascending order of rate of
  change. In other words, the first column would be the fastest changing
  position dimension and the last column would be the slowest.

  * A simple gray-scale photograph with N pixels would have ancillary position
    datasets of size N x 2. The first column would be the columns (faster)
    and the second would be the rows assuming that the data was collected
    column-by-column and then row-by-row.

* The ``Spectroscopic Values`` and ``Spectroscopic Indices`` dataset would
  both be ``V x S`` in shape, where ``V`` is the number of spectroscopic
  dimensions. Similarly to the position dimensions, the first row would be
  the fastest changing spectroscopic dimension while the last row would be
  the slowest.

The ancillary datasets are better illustrated using an example. Let's
take the **IV Spectorscopy** example from above, which has two position
dimensions - X and Y, and three spectroscopic dimensions - Voltage,
Cycle, Step.

-  If the dataset had 2 rows and 3 columns, the corresponding
   ``Position Indices`` dataset would be:

+-------+-----+
|   X   | Y   |
+=======+=====+
| 0     | 0   |
+-------+-----+
| 1     | 0   |
+-------+-----+
| 2     | 0   |
+-------+-----+
| 0     | 1   |
+-------+-----+
| 1     | 1   |
+-------+-----+
| 2     | 1   |
+-------+-----+

-  Note that indices start from 0 instead of 1 and end at N-1 instead of
   N in lines with common programming languages such as C or python.
-  Correpondingly, if the measurements were performed at X locations:
   0.0, 1.5, and 3.0 microns and Y locations: -7.0 and 2.3 nanometers,
   the ``Position Values`` dataset may look like the table below:

+----------+----------+
| X [um]   | Y [nm]   |
+==========+==========+
| 0.0      | -7.0     |
+----------+----------+
| 1.5      | -7.0     |
+----------+----------+
| 3.0      | -7.0     |
+----------+----------+
| 0.0      | 2.3      |
+----------+----------+
| 1.5      | 2.3      |
+----------+----------+
| 3.0      | 2.3      |
+----------+----------+

-  Note that X and Y have different units - microns and nanometers.
   Pycroscopy has been designed to handle variations in the units for
   each of these dimensions. Details regarding how and where to store
   the information regarding the ``labels`` ('X', 'Y') and ``units`` for
   these dimensions ('um', 'nm') will be discussed below.
-  If the dataset had 3 bias values in each cycle, each cycle repeated 2
   times, and there were 5 such bias waveforms or steps; the
   ``Spectroscopic Indices`` would be:

+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| Bias    | 0   | 1   | 2   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 0   | 1   | 2   | .   | .   | .   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 0   | 1   | 2   |
+=========+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
| Cycle   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | .   | .   | .   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| Step    | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | .   | .   | .   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 4   | 4   | 4   | 4   | 4   | 4   |
+---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

-  Similarly, the ``Spectroscopic Values`` table would be structured as:

+------------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+
| Bias [V]   | -6.5   | 0.0   | 6.5   | -6.5   | 0.0   | 6.5   | -6.5   | 0.0   | 6.5   | .   | .   | .   | 6.5   | -6.5   | 0.0   | 6.5   | -6.5   | 0.0   | 6.5   |
+============+========+=======+=======+========+=======+=======+========+=======+=======+=====+=====+=====+=======+========+=======+=======+========+=======+=======+
| Cycle []   | 0      | 0     | 0     | 1      | 1     | 1     | 0      | 0     | 0     | .   | .   | .   | 1     | 0      | 0     | 0     | 1      | 1     | 1     |
+------------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+
| Step []    | 0      | 0     | 0     | 0      | 0     | 0     | 1      | 1     | 1     | .   | .   | .   | 3     | 4      | 4     | 4     | 4      | 4     | 4     |
+------------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+

-  Thus, the data at the fourth row and seventh column of the main
   dataset can be explained using these ancillary datasets as data from:

   -  X index of 0, with value of 0.0 microns
   -  Y index of 1 and value of 2.3 nm
      where a bias of index 0 and value of -6.5 V was being applied
      on the first cycle
      of the second bias waveform step.
-  A simple glance at the shape of these datsets would be enough to
   reveal that the data has two position dimensions (from the second
   axis of the ``Position Indices`` dataset) and three spectroscopic
   dimensions (from the first axis of the ``Spectroscopic Indices``
   dataset)

Channels
^^^^^^^^
The pycroscopy data model also allows multiple channels of information
to be recorded as separate datasets in the same file. For example, one
channel could be a spectra (1D array) collected at each location on a 2D
grid while another could be the temperature (single value) recorded by
another sensor at the same spatial positions. In this case, the two
datasets could indeed share the same ancillary position datasets but
different spectroscopic datasets. Alternatively, there could be other
cases where the average measurement over multiple spatial points is
recorded separately (possibly by another detector). In this case, the
two measurement datasets would not share the ancillary position datasets
as well. Other specifics regarding the implementation of different
channels will be discussed in a later section.

File Format
-------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No one really wants yet another file format in their lives. We wanted to adopt a file format that satisfies some basic requirements:

* already widely accepted in scientific research
* support parallel read and write capabilities.
* store multiple datasets of different shapes, dimensionalities, precision and sizes.
* scale very efficiently from few kilobytes to several terabytes
* can be (readily) read and modified using any language including Python, R, Matlab,
  C/C++, Java, Fortran, Igor Pro, etc. without requiring installation of modules that are hard to install
* store and organize data in a intuitive and familiar hierarchical / tree-like
  structure that is similar to files and folders in personal computers.
* facilitates storage of any number of experimental or analysis parameters
  in addition to regular data.
* highly flexible and poses minimal restrictions on how the data can and should be stored.
* readily compatible with high-performance computing (``HPC``) and cloud-computing

Candidates
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* We found that existing file formats in science such as the `Nexus data format <http://www.nexusformat.org>`_,
  `XDMF <http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/Main_Page>`_, and `NetCDF <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`_:

  * were designed for **specific / narrow scientific domains only** and we did not want to shoehorn our data structure into those formats.
  * Furthermore, despite being some of the more popular scientific data formats, it is **not immediately straightforward to read those files**
    on every computer using any programming language. For example - the `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/>`_
    python distribution does not come with any packages for reading these file formats.
* `Adios <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/adios/>`_ is perhaps the ultimate file format for storing petabyte sized data on supercomputers but
  it was specifically designed for simulations, check-pointing, and it trades flexibility, and ease-of-use for performance.
* The `hierarchical data format (HDF5) <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.intro.html>`_ is the implicitly or explicitly the
  `de-facto standard in scientific research <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/users5.html>`_.
  In fact, Nexus, NetCDF, and even `Matlab's .mat <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/mat-file-versions.html>`_
  files are actually (now) just custom flavors of HDF5 thereby validating the statement that HDF5 is the **unanimous the file format of choice**
* The `DREAM.3D <http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/binaries/Help/DREAM3D/nativedream3d.html>`_ is yet another group that uses HDF5
  as the base container to store their data. We are currently evaluating compatibility with and feasibility of their data model.

We found that `HDF5 <http://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/files/2015/03/HDF5-Intro-aug7-130.pdf>`_, works best for us compared to the alternatives.
Hence, pycroscopy has officially adopted the HD5 file format.

We acknowledge that it is nearly impossible to find the perfect file format and HDF5 too has its fair share of drawbacks.
One common observation among file formats is that a file format optimized for the cloud or cluster computing often does
not perform well (or at all) on HPC due to the conflicting nature of the computing paradigms.
As of this writing, HDF5 is optimized for HPC and not for cloud-based applications.
For cloud-based environments it is beneficial to in fact break up the data into
small chunks that can be individually addressed and used. We think `Zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and
`N5 <https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5>`_ would be good alternatives; however, most of these file formats are very much in
their infancy and have not proven themselves like HDF5 has. This being said, the HDF organization
`just announced <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tP3lT5y-QA>`_ a `cloud flavor <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf-cloud/>`_
of HDF5 and we plan to look into this once h5py or other python packages support such capabilities.

Implementation in HDF5
-----------------------

Here we discuss guidelines and specifications for implementing the
pycroscopy data structure in HDF5 files.

Quick basics of HDF5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Information can be stored in HDF5 files in several ways:

* ``Datasets`` allow the storage of data matrices and these are the vessels used for storing the ``main``,
  ``ancillary``, and any extra data matrices
* ``Groups`` are similar to folders in conventional file systems and can be used to store any number of datasets or
  groups themselves
* ``Attributes`` are small pieces of information, such as experimental or analytical parameters, that are stored in
  key-value pairs in the same way as dictionaries in python.  Both groups and datasets can store attributes.
* While they are not means to store data, ``Links`` or ``references`` can be used to provide shortcuts and aliases to
  datasets and groups. This feature is especially useful for avoiding duplication of datasets when two ``main``
  datasets use the same ancillary datasets.

``Main`` data:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Dataset** structured as (positions x time or spectroscopic values)

* ``dtype`` : uint8, float32, complex64, compound if necessary, etc.
* *Required* attributes:

  * ``quantity`` - Single string that explains the data. The physical
    quantity contained in each cell of the dataset – eg –
    'Current' or 'Deflection'
  * ``units`` – Single string for units. The units for the physical
    quantity like 'nA', 'V', 'pF', etc.
  * ``Position_Indices`` - Reference to the position indices dataset
  * ``Position_Values`` - Reference to the position values dataset
  * ``Spectroscopic_Indices`` - Reference to the spectroscopic indices
    dataset
  * ``Spectroscopic_Values`` - Reference to the spectroscopic values
    dataset

* `chunking <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc1.8/Advanced/Chunking/index.html>`__
  : HDF group recommends that chunks be between 100 kB to 1 MB. We
  recommend chunking by whole number of positions since data is more
  likely to be read by position rather than by specific spectral indices.

Note that we are only storing references to the ancillary datasets. This
allows multiple ``main`` datasets to share the same ancillary datasets
without having to duplicate them.

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~
All groups and (at least ``Main``) datasets must be created with the following **mandatory** attributes for better traceability:

-  ``time_stamp`` : '2017\_08\_15-22\_15\_45' (date and time of creation
   of the group or dataset formatted as 'YYYY\_MM\_DD-HH\_mm\_ss' as
   a string)
-  ``machine_id`` : 'mac1234.ornl.gov' (a fully qualified domain name as
   a string)
-  ``pycroscopy_version`` : '0.60.0'
-  ``platform`` : 'Windows10....' or something like 'Darwin-17.4.0-x86_64-i386-64bit' (for Mac OS) -
   a long string providing detailed information about the operating system

Groups
~~~~~~~~~~

HDF5 Groups in pycroscopy are used to organize categories of information (raw measurements from instruments, results from data analysis, etc.) in an intuitive manner.

Measurement data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  As mentioned earlier, instrument users may change experimental
   parameters during measurements. Even if these changes are minor, they
   can lead to misinterpretation of data if the changes are not handled
   robustly. To solve this problem, we recommend storing data under **indexed**
   groups named as ``Measurement_00x``. Each time the parameters
   are changed, the dataset is truncated to the point until which data
   was collected and a new group is created to store the upcoming
   new measurement data.
-  Each **channel** of information acquired during the measurement gets
   its own group.
-  The ``Main`` datasets would reside within these channel groups.
-  Similar to the measurement groups, the channel groups are
   named as ``Channel_00x``. The index for the group is incremented
   according to the index of the information channel.
-  Depending on the circumstances, the ancillary datasets can be shared
   among channels.

   -  Instead of the main dataset in ``Channel_001`` having references to
      the ancillary datasets in ``Channel_000``, we recommend placing the
      ancillary datasets outside the Channel groups in a area common
      to both channel groups. Typically, this is the
      ``Measurement_00x`` group.

-  This is what the tree structure in the file looks like when
   experimental parameters were changed twice and there are two channels
   of information being acquired during the measurements.
-  Datasets common to all measurement groups (perhaps some calibration
   data that is acquired only once before all measurements)
-  ``Measurement_000`` (group)

   -  ``Channel_000`` (group)

      -  Datasets here

   -  ``Channel_001`` (group)

      -  Datasets here

   -  Datasets common to ``Channel_000`` and ``Channel_001``

-  ``Measurement_001`` (group)

   -  ``Channel_000`` (group)

      -  Datasets here

   -  ``Channel_001`` (group)

      -  Datasets here

   -  Datasets common to ``Channel_000`` and ``Channel_001``

-  ...

Tool (analysis / processing)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Each time an analysis or processing routine, referred generally as
   ``tool``, is performed on a dataset of interest, the results are
   stored in new HDF5 datasets within a new HSF5 group.
-  A completely new dataset(s) and group are created even if a minor
   operation is being performed on the dataset. In other words, we **do NOT modify existing datasets**.
-  Almost always, the tool is applied to one (or more) ``main`` datasets (referred to
   as the ``source`` dataset) and at least one of the results is
   typically also a ``main`` dataset. These new ``main`` datasets will
   either need to be linked to the ancillary matrices of the ``source``
   or to new ancillary datasets that will need to be created.
-  The resultant dataset(s) are always stored in a group whose name
   is derived from the names of the tool and the dataset. This makes the
   data **traceable**, meaning that the names of the datasets and
   groups are sufficient to understand what processing or analysis
   steps were applied to the data to bring it to a particular point.
-  The group is named as ``Source_Dataset-Tool_Name_00x``, where a
   ``tool`` named ``Tool_Name`` is applied to a ``main`` dataset named
   ``Source_Dataset``.

   -  Since there is a possibility that the same tool could be applied
      to the very same dataset multiple times, we store the results of
      each run of the tool in a separate group. These groups are
      differentiated by the index that is appended to the name of
      the group.
   -  Note that a ``-`` separates the dataset name from the tool name
      and anything after the last ``_`` will be assumed to be the index
      of the group
   -  Please refer to the advanced topics section for tools that have **more than one**
      ``source`` datasets

-  In general, the results from tools applied to datasets should be
   stored as:

    -  ``Source_Dataset``
    -  ``Source_Dataset-Tool_Name_000`` (group containing results from
       first run of the ``tool`` on ``Source_Dataset``)

       -  Attributes:

          -  all mandatory attributes
          -  ``algorithm``
          -  Other tool-relevant attributes
          -  ``source_000`` - reference to ``Source_Dataset``

       -  ``Dataset_Result0``
       -  ``Dataset_Result1`` ...

    -  ``Source_Dataset-Tool_Name_001`` (group containing results from
       second run of the ``tool`` on ``Source_Dataset``)

-  This methodology is illustrated with an example of applying
   ``K-Means Clustering`` on the ``Raw_Data`` acquired from a measurement:

    -  ``Raw_Data`` (``main`` dataset)
    -  ``Raw_Data-Cluster_000`` (group)
    -  Attributes:

           -  all mandatory attributes
           -  ``algorithm`` : 'K-Means'
           -  ``source_000`` : reference to ``Raw_Data``

    -  ``Label_Indices`` (ancillary spectroscopic dataset with 1 dimension of size 1)
    -  ``Label_Values`` (ancillary spectroscopic dataset with 1 dimension of size 1)
    -  ``Labels`` (Main dataset)

       -  Attributes:

          -  ``quantity`` : 'Cluster labels'
          -  ``units`` : 'a. u.'
          -  ``Position_Indices`` : Reference to ``Position_Indices`` from
             attribute of ``Raw_Data``
          -  ``Position_Values`` : Reference to ``Position_Values`` from
             attribute of ``Raw_Data``
          -  ``Spectroscopic_Indices`` : Reference to ``Label_Indices``
          -  ``Spectroscopic_Values`` : Reference to ``Label_Values``
          -  all mandatory attributes

    -  ``Cluster_Indices`` (ancillary positions dataset with 1 dimension of size equal to number of clusters)
    -  ``Cluster_Values`` (ancillary positions dataset with 1 dimension of size equal to number of clusters)
    -  ``Mean_Response`` (main dataset) <- This dataset stores the endmembers
       or mean response for each cluster

       -  Attributes:

          -  ``quantity`` : copy from the ``quantity`` attribute in
             ``Raw_Data``
          -  ``units`` : copy from the ``units`` attribute in ``Raw_Data``
          -  ``Position_Indices`` : Reference to ``Cluster_Indices``
          -  ``Position_Values`` : Reference to ``Cluster_Values``
          -  ``Spectroscopic_Indices`` : Reference to ``Spectroscopic_Indices``
             from attribute of ``Raw_Data``
          -  ``Spectroscopic_Values`` : Reference to ``Spectroscopic_Values``
             from attribute of ``Raw_Data``
          -  all mandatory attributes

-  Note that the spectroscopic datasets that the ``Labels`` dataset link
   to are not called ``Spectroscopic_Indices`` or
   ``Spectroscopic_Values`` themselves. They only need to follow the
   specifications outlined above. The same is true for the position
   datasets for ``Mean_Response``.

Advanced topics
----------------

``Region references``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are references to sections of a ``main`` or ``ancillary`` dataset that make it easy to access data specfic to a
specific portion of the measurement, or each column or row in the ancillary datasets just by their alias (intuitive
strings for names).

We have observed that the average pycroscopy user does not tend to use region references as much as we thought they
might. Therefore, we do not require or enforce that region references be used

Processing on multiple ``Main`` datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One popular scientific workflow we anticipate involves the usage of multiple ``source`` datasets to create results.
By definition, this breaks the current nomenclature of HDF5 groups that will contain results. This will be addressed by
restructuring the code in such a way that the results group could be named as: ``Multi_Dataset-Tool_Name_000``. To improve
the robustness of the solution, we have already begun storing the necessary information as attributes of the HDF5
results groups. Here are the attributes of the group that we expect to capture the references to all the datasets along
with the name of the tool while relaxing the restrictions on the aforementioned nomenclature:

* ``tool`` : <string> - Name of the tool / process applied to the datasets
* ``num_sources``: <unsigned integer> - Number of source datasets that take part in the process
* ``source_000`` : <HDF5 object reference> - reference to the first source dataset
* ``source_001`` : <HDF5 object reference> - reference to the second source dataset ...

We would have to break the list of references to the source datasets into individual attributes since h5py / HDF5
currently does not allow the value of an attribute to be a list of object references.

Sparse Sampling / Compressed Sensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In many cases, especially electron and ion based microscopy, the very act of probing the sample damages the sample.
In order to minimize damage to the sample, researchers only sample data from a few random positions in the 2D grid of
positions and use advanced algorithms to reconstruct the missing data. This scientific problem presents a data storage
challenge. The naive approach would be to store a giant matrix of zeros with only a available positions filled in.
This is highly inefficient since the space occupied by the data would be equal to that of the complete (non-sparse)
dataset.

For such sparse sampling problems, we propose that the indices for each position be identical and still range from ``0``
to ``N-1`` for a dataset with ``N`` randomly sampled positions. Thus, for an example dataset with two position dimensions,
the indices would be arranged as:

+-------+-------+
|   X   |   Y   |
+=======+=======+
|  0    |   0   |
+-------+-------+
|  1    |   1   |
+-------+-------+
|  2    |   2   |
+-------+-------+
|  .    |   .   |
+-------+-------+
|  N-2  |  N-2  |
+-------+-------+
|  N-1  |  N-1  |
+-------+-------+

However, the position values would contain the actual values:

+-------+-------+
|   X   |   Y   |
+=======+=======+
|  9.5  |  1.5  |
+-------+-------+
|  3.6  |  7.4  |
+-------+-------+
|  5.4  |  8.2  |
+-------+-------+
|  .    |   .   |
+-------+-------+
|  1.2  |  3.9  |
+-------+-------+
|  4.8  |  6.1  |
+-------+-------+

The spectroscopic ancillary datasets would be constructed and defined in the traditional methods since the sampling in
the spectroscopic dimension is identical for all measurements.

The vast majority of the existing features including signal filtering, statistical machine learning algorithms, etc. in
pycroscopy could still be applied to such datasets.

By nature of its definition, such a dataset will certainly pose problems when attempting to reshape to its N-dimensional
form among other things. Pycroscopy currently does not have any scientific algorithms or real datasets specifically
written for such data but this will be addressed in the near future. This is section is presented to show that we
have indeed thought about such advanced problems as well when designing the universal data structure.
