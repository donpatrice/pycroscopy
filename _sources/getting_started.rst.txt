Getting Started
---------------
* Follow `these instructions <./install.html>`_ to install pycroscopy
* See how we use pycroscopy for our scientific research in these `jupyter notebooks <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/tree/master/jupyter_notebooks/>`_.
* See `journal publications <./papers_conferences.html>`_ that used pycroscopy.
* We have also compiled a list of `handy tutorials <./external_guides.html>`_ on basic / prerequisite topics such as programming in python, data analytics, machine learning, etc.
* See our `examples <./auto_examples/index.html>`_ to get started on using and writing your own pycroscopy functions
* We already have `many translators <./translators.html>`_ that transform data from popular microscope data formats to pycroscopy compatible HDF5 files.
    * We also have `tutorials  <./auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_numpy_translator.html>`_ to get you started on importing your other data to pycroscopy.
* Details regarding the definition, implementation, and guidelines for pycroscopy's `data format <./data_format.html>`_ for HDF5 are also available.
* Please see our document on the `organization of pycroscopy <./package_organization.html>`_ to find out more on what is where and why.
* We can guide you to convert your file formats into pycroscopy compatible HDF5 files and help you get started with data analysis.
* If you are interested in contributing and are looking for topics we are / will work on, please look at our `To Do <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/ToDo.rst>`_ page
